Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me

'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
