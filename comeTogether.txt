Here come old flat-top, he come
Groovin' UPP slowly, he got
Ju-ju eyeballs, he want
Holy rollers, he got
Hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine, he got
Toe-jam football, he got
Monkey finger, he shoot
Coca-Cola, he say
I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
