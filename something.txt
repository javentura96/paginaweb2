Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile, she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
